stone-soup-clojurescript-guide
==============================

This project is intended to be a crowdsourced documentation effort describing how to
develop ClojureScript applications. For now, everything interesting here is in the
project [Wiki](https://github.com/deg/stone-soup-clojurescript-guide/wiki). You'll
notice that most of the pages are still very sketchy and that some of them wander pretty
far from a tight focus on ClojureScript. This is deliberate. My intent is to capture
interesting links as I find them and then gradullay edit this into a cohesive
whole. Contributions are very welcome.

In the future, I hope to expand this project by also including sample code in the main
repo.
